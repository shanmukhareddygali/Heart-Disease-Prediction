# Heart-Disease-Prediction

## Industry Context :

In the healthcare industry, heart disease remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, necessitating effective prediction and early intervention strategies. Leveraging logistic regression for heart disease prediction allows healthcare providers to analyze patient data—such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle factors—to assess the likelihood of developing heart-related conditions. By transforming complex medical data into actionable insights, this approach not only enhances clinical decision-making but also facilitates targeted prevention efforts, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. Implementing such predictive models can aid healthcare organizations in optimizing resource allocation and developing personalized treatment plans.

# Project Objective : 

In this project, we analyze a dataset containing health metrics from heart patients, such as age, blood pressure, and heart rate, to develop a predictive model for identifying individuals with heart disease. Our primary objective is to ensure comprehensive detection of potential patients, prioritizing recall for the positive class to minimize the risk of missed diagnoses.

## About Data : 
The dataset consists of 303 rows and 14 columns, with no missing values. All features are represented as numerical data.

## Data Preprocessing : 
With no outliers detected in the dataset, the data is split into an 80:20 ratio for training and testing.

## Model Selection : 
Logistic Regression model is selected.

## Model Evaluation : 
The model achieved the best Roc-Auc score of 0.90 using Logistic Regression
## Business Impact : 
Early detection of heart disease allows healthcare providers to implement preventive measures, reducing the frequency and severity of hospitalizations. This leads to lower healthcare costs and improved patient outcomes, benefiting insurance companies and reducing strain on medical resources.
Identifying high-risk individuals early can reduce the need for costly emergency treatments and prolonged hospital stays, leading to cost savings for healthcare providers and insurers by lowering the burden of acute interventions and long-term care.
