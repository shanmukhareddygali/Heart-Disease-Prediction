# Heart-Disease-Prediction

## Industry Context :

In the healthcare industry, heart disease remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, necessitating effective prediction and early intervention strategies. Leveraging logistic regression for heart disease prediction allows healthcare providers to analyze patient data—such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle factors—to assess the likelihood of developing heart-related conditions. By transforming complex medical data into actionable insights, this approach not only enhances clinical decision-making but also facilitates targeted prevention efforts, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. Implementing such predictive models can aid healthcare organizations in optimizing resource allocation and developing personalized treatment plans.
